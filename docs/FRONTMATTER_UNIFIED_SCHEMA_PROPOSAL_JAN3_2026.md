# Frontmatter Unified Schema Proposal

**Date**: January 3, 2026  
**Status**: 🔴 PROPOSAL - Awaiting Approval  
**Impact**: High - Affects all frontmatter files (materials, contaminants, settings, compounds)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Problem**: Materials frontmatter uses scattered, flat structure with unclear content organization. Contaminants use superior subject-area concentration under `relationships` key.

**Solution**: Unify all content types under consistent subject-area schema with clear relationship keys.

**Benefit**: 
- ✅ Obvious subject area concentrations
- ✅ Clear content section separation
- ✅ Consistent structure across all content types
- ✅ Better component rendering logic
- ✅ Easier maintenance and navigation

---

## 📊 Current State Analysis (All 4 Domains)

**Regeneration Date**: January 3, 2026  
**Files Analyzed**: 132 materials, 88 contaminants, 132 settings, 9 compounds  
**Total Size**: ~200,000 lines across all frontmatter

---

### 1️⃣ Materials (⚠️ Partially Improved, Still Issues)

**File**: `yttria-stabilized-zirconia-laser-cleaning.yaml` (450 lines, recently regenerated)

```yaml
# CURRENT STATE - Mix of old and new patterns
name: Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia
category: ceramic
micro:                              # ❌ Still top-level
  before: "..."
  after: "..."
faq: [{...}]                        # ❌ Still top-level
components:                          # ❌ Still confusing
  micro: {before: "...", after: "..."}  # ❌ Duplicate of above!
properties:                          # ✅ Good - technical data
  material_characteristics: {...}
  laser_material_interaction: {...}
contamination:                       # ❌ Old format
  valid: [...]
  prohibited: [...]
relationships:
  interactions:
    contaminated_by:
      presentation: card           # ✅ NEW - Has presentation
      items: [id1, id2...]         # ❌ Still just flat IDs
      sectionMetadata:             # ✅ NEW - Has metadata!
        sectionTitle: "Common Contaminants"
        sectionDescription: "Types of contamination..."
        icon: droplet
        order: 1
  operational:                      # ✅ NEW - Subject area!
    expert_answers:
      presentation: collapsible    # ✅ Has presentation
      items:
        - question: "..."
          answer: "..."
          severity: medium
```

**Assessment:**
- ✅ **IMPROVED**: Added `sectionMetadata` with titles, descriptions, icons, order
- ✅ **IMPROVED**: Added `presentation` hints (card, collapsible)
- ✅ **IMPROVED**: Started using subject areas (`operational.expert_answers`)
- ❌ **STILL BROKEN**: Duplicate `micro` (top-level AND in components)
- ❌ **STILL BROKEN**: `faq` at top level AND in `relationships.operational.expert_answers`
- ❌ **STILL SCATTERED**: Content across multiple locations
- ⚠️ **CONFUSING**: `components` purpose unclear (has micro/description)

**Grade**: C+ (Was F, now partially improved but still inconsistent)

### 3️⃣ Settings (⚠️ Partially Improved, Similar to Materials)

**File**: `aluminum-settings.yaml` (368 lines, recently regenerated)

```yaml
# CURRENT STATE - Mix of patterns
name: Aluminum
content_type: settings
relationships:
  safety:                           # ✅ NEW - Subject area
    regulatory_standards:
      presentation: card
      items: [{id: "...", type: "..."}]
      sectionMetadata:              # ✅ Has metadata
        sectionTitle: "Safety Standards & Compliance"
        icon: shield-check
        order: 10
  
  interactions:                     # ✅ Subject area
    removes_contaminants:
      presentation: card
      items:
        - id: rust-oxidation-contamination
          effectiveness: high       # ✅ Rich metadata!
```

**Assessment:**
- ✅ **IMPROVED**: Using relationship subject areas
- ✅ **IMPROVED**: Has sectionMetadata
- ✅ **IMPROVED**: Presentation hints present
- ✅ **GOOD**: Rich metadata (effectiveness levels)
- ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE**: Need more subject areas (compatibility, equipment, etc.)

**Grade**: B (Better than materials, but less complete than contaminants)

---

### 4️⃣ Compounds (⚠️ Minimal Structure)

**File**: `metal-vapors-mixed-compound.yaml` (250 lines, recently regenerated)

```yaml
# CURRENT STATE - Minimal relationships
name: Metal Vapors (Mixed)
category: vapor
hazard_class: irritant
chemical_formula: Various
health_effects: "Long text content..."  # ❌ Top-level content
exposure_guidelines: "Long text..."     # ❌ Top-level content
detection_methods: "Long text..."       # ❌ Top-level content
first_aid: "Long text..."              # ❌ Top-level content
ppe_requirements: "Long text..."        # ❌ Top-level content
faq: [{...}]                           # ❌ Top-level content
relationships:
  interactions:                         # ⚠️ Only one subject area
    produced_from_contaminants:
      presentation: card
      items:
        - id: brass-plating-contamination
          frequency: unknown
          severity: moderate
          typical_context: "Laser removal of..."
  
  safety:                               # ✅ Has safety section
    health_effects:
      - route: inhalation
        effect: "..."
        severity: moderate
        onset: short-term
```

**Assessment:**
- ⚠️ **MIXED**: Has some subject areas (interactions, safety)
- ❌ **SCATTERED**: Most content at top level (health_effects, exposure_guidelines, etc.)
- ✅ **GOOD**: Rich metadata in relationship items (frequency, severity, context)
- ❌ **INCOMPLETE**: Missing subject areas (formation, applications, handling)
- ❌ **INCONSISTENT**: Some content in relationships, some at top level

**Grade**: C (Basic structure present but content scattered)

---

## 📊 Domain Comparison Matrix

| Domain | Subject Areas | Presentation | sectionMetadata | Rich Items | Content Location | Grade |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|------------------|-------|
| **Materials** | ⚠️ Partial (2/5) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ Flat IDs | ❌ Scattered | C+ |
| **Contaminants** | ✅ Complete (4/4) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Structured | ✅ Concentrated | A+ |
| **Settings** | ⚠️ Partial (2/4) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Some rich | ⚠️ Mostly good | B |
| **Compounds** | ⚠️ Minimal (2/6) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Some rich | ❌ Very scattered | C |

---

## 🎯 Key Findings

### ✅ Positive Progress
1. **sectionMetadata** added to materials/settings (title, description, icon, order)
2. **Presentation hints** present across all domains
3. **Subject areas emerging** in all domains (but incomplete)
4. **Contaminants are perfect** - gold standard achieved

### ❌ Critical Issues Remaining
1. **Content duplication** in materials (micro at top + in components, faq top + in relationships)
2. **Scattered content** in compounds (most content at top level)
3. **Incomplete subject areas** in materials/settings/compounds
4. **Inconsistent patterns** across domains (each uses different structure)
5. **`components` confusion** in materials (unclear purpose)

---

## 🔍 Detailed Domain Analysis

### Materials - Current Issues

**Duplicate Content Problem:**
```yaml
# PROBLEM: micro appears in TWO places
micro:                              # Location 1 (top-level)
  before: "The durability of yttria-stabilized..."
  after: "After cleaning, the surface reveals..."

components:                          # Location 2 (nested)
  micro:
    before: "We've found the contaminated surface..."
    after: "After laser treatment, the surface appears..."
```

**FAQ Duplication Problem:**
```yaml
# PROBLEM: FAQ content in TWO places
faq:                                # Location 1 (top-level)
  - question: "How do I safely laser clean YSZ?"
    answer: "I've seen YSZ hold up well..."

relationships:
  operational:
    expert_answers:                 # Location 2 (relationship)
      items:
        - question: "How do I safely laser clean YSZ?"
          answer: "I've seen YSZ hold up well..."
```

**Result**: Confusing, maintenance nightmare, unclear which is authoritative

---

### Contaminants - Gold Standard ⭐

**Why It Works:**
```yaml
relationships:
  safety:                           # Subject area 1
    regulatory_standards: {...}     # 5+ rich subsections
    ppe_requirements: {...}
    toxic_gas_risk: {...}
    fumes_generated: {...}
    ventilation_requirements: {...}
  
  interactions:                     # Subject area 2
    produces_compounds: {...}       # 2 rich subsections
    affects_materials: {...}
  
  visual:                           # Subject area 3
    appearance_on_categories:       # 1 mega-detailed section
      metal: {appearance, coverage, pattern, texture...}
      ceramic: {appearance, coverage, pattern, texture...}
      # 12 material categories with full details
  
  operational:                      # Subject area 4
    laser_properties: {...}         # 3 rich subsections
    removal_characteristics: {...}
```

**Result**: Clear organization, no duplication, easy to navigate, obvious rendering

---

### Settings - Needs Expansion

**Current (Good start):**
```yaml
relationships:
  safety:
    regulatory_standards: {...}
  interactions:
    removes_contaminants:
      items:
        - id: rust-oxidation-contamination
          effectiveness: high       # ✅ Rich metadata
```

**Missing Subject Areas:**
- `compatibility` - Which materials work with these settings?
- `equipment` - Compatible laser systems/manufacturers
- `applications` - Industry-specific use cases
- `optimization` - Parameter tuning guidance

---

### Compounds - Needs Restructuring

**Current Problems:**
```yaml
# SCATTERED CONTENT at top level
health_effects: "3000 character string..."
exposure_guidelines: "2000 character string..."
detection_methods: "1500 character string..."
first_aid: "1000 character string..."
ppe_requirements: "2000 character string..."
faq: [{...}]

# MINIMAL relationships section
relationships:
  interactions:
    produced_from_contaminants: {...}
  safety:
    health_effects: [{route, effect, severity}]  # ❌ Duplicate of top-level!
```

**Should Be:**
```yaml
# Clean metadata at top
chemical_formula: "Fe2O3"
cas_number: "1309-37-1"

# ALL content in relationships
relationships:
  safety:
    health_effects: {...}
    exposure_guidelines: {...}
    ppe_requirements: {...}
    first_aid: {...}
  
  formation:
    produced_from_contaminants: {...}
    reaction_conditions: {...}
  
  detection:
    methods: {...}
    monitoring: {...}
```

## 🎨 Presentation System

Each relationship section declares how it should be rendered:

```yaml
relationships:
  contamination:
    presentation: section      # Parent presentation
    affected_by:
      presentation: card       # Child presentation
      items: [...]
```

**Presentation Types:**
- `section` - Major collapsible section
- `card` - Card grid layout
- `table` - Tabular data display
- `descriptive` - Rich text with structured data
- `list` - Simple list layout
- `timeline` - Temporal sequence
- `comparison` - Side-by-side comparison

## 📊 Benefits Analysis

### Developer Experience
- ✅ **Obvious structure**: `relationships.safety` vs scattered fields
- ✅ **Consistent patterns**: All content types use same structure
- ✅ **Type safety**: Clear interfaces for all sections
- ✅ **Easy navigation**: Subject areas are self-documenting

### Content Quality
- ✅ **Clear separation**: Content vs data vs relationships
- ✅ **Rich context**: Relationships have metadata (frequency, severity, etc.)
- ✅ **Presentation hints**: Components know how to render each section
- ✅ **Scalability**: Easy to add new subject areas

### Maintenance
- ✅ **Single source**: One schema for all content types
- ✅ **Clear ownership**: Each section has obvious purpose
- ✅ **Easy updates**: Add new relationship types without breaking existing
- ✅ **Validation**: Schema-driven validation catches errors

### Component Rendering
```typescript
// Before (scattered)
if (material.micro) renderMicro(material.micro);
if (material.faq) renderFAQ(material.faq);
if (material.relationships?.interactions?.contaminated_by) ...;

// After (unified)
material.content.sections.forEach(section => {
  renderSection(section, section.presentation);
});

material.relationships.subjectAreas.forEach(area => {
  renderSubjectArea(area, area.presentation);
});
```

## 🚦 Decision Points

### ✅ Approved Changes
- Move to subject-area concentration under `relationships`
- Create `content` parent key for all generated text
- Add `presentation` metadata to all relationship sections

### ⏳ Pending Decisions
1. **Schema version**: Jump to v6.0.0 or increment to v5.1.0?
2. **Migration timing**: All at once or phased by domain?
3. **Backward compatibility**: Support old schema during transition?
4. **Validation**: Strict (fail on old format) or permissive (warn only)?

### 🔄 Backward Compatibility Options

**Option A: Hard Break (Recommended)**
- Update all frontmatter at once
- Components only support new schema
- Clean, no technical debt
- Risk: Downtime during migration

**Option B: Dual Support**
- Components support both schemas
- Gradual migration per domain
- Safe, no downtime
- Risk: Technical debt, complex code

## 🎯 Recommended Actions by Domain

### 1️⃣ Materials (HIGH PRIORITY - Most Work Needed)

**Immediate Fixes:**
1. ❌ **Remove duplicate `micro`** - Keep only in `content.visual.micro`
2. ❌ **Remove duplicate `faq`** - Keep only in `relationships.operational.expert_answers`
3. ❌ **Eliminate `components`** - Unclear purpose, content belongs elsewhere
4. ✅ **Preserve `sectionMetadata`** - Already added, working well
5. ✅ **Expand subject areas**:
   - `contamination` → `relationships.interactions.affected_by`
   - Add `relationships.compatibility` (works_with_materials, settings_references)
   - Add `relationships.applications` (industries, processes)

**Effort**: 2-3 weeks (132 materials × ~10 minutes each)

---

### 2️⃣ Contaminants (LOW PRIORITY - Already Excellent ⭐)

**Minor Tweaks Only:**
1. ✅ **Keep current structure** - It's the gold standard
2. ⚠️ **Optional**: Move `visual.appearance_on_categories` to `content.visual` if desired
3. ✅ **Document patterns** for other domains to follow

**Effort**: 1-2 days (documentation only)

---

### 3️⃣ Settings (MEDIUM PRIORITY - Expand Subject Areas)

**Additions Needed:**
1. ✅ **Keep current structure** - Good foundation
2. ➕ **Add `relationships.compatibility`**:
   ```yaml
   compatibility:
     optimized_for_materials:
       presentation: card
       items: [{id: "...", optimization_level: "primary"}]
   ```
3. ➕ **Add `relationships.equipment`**:
   ```yaml
   equipment:
     compatible_systems:
       presentation: table
       items: [{manufacturer: "...", model: "...", compatibility: "excellent"}]
   ```
4. ➕ **Add `relationships.applications`**:
   ```yaml
   applications:
     use_cases:
       presentation: descriptive
       items: [{process: "...", parameters: "..."}]
   ```

**Effort**: 1 week (132 settings × ~5 minutes each)

---

### 4️⃣ Compounds (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY - Restructure Content)

**Major Refactoring:**
1. ❌ **Move all text content to relationships**:
   - `health_effects` → `relationships.safety.health_effects`
   - `exposure_guidelines` → `relationships.safety.exposure_guidelines`
   - `detection_methods` → `relationships.detection.methods`
   - `first_aid` → `relationships.safety.first_aid`
   - `ppe_requirements` → `relationships.safety.ppe_requirements`
   - `faq` → `relationships.operational.expert_answers`

2. ✅ **Keep only metadata at top level**:
   - `chemical_formula`, `cas_number`, `molecular_weight`
   - `hazard_class`, `category`, `subcategory`

3. ➕ **Add missing subject areas**:
   ```yaml
   relationships:
     formation:
       produced_from_contaminants: {...}
       reaction_conditions: {...}
     detection:
       methods: {...}
       monitoring_requirements: {...}
     handling:
       storage_requirements: {...}
       disposal_procedures: {...}
   ```

**Effort**: 1 week (9 compounds × ~60 minutes each)
